## Introduction to 2D Arrays

In C++, 2D arrays are used to represent tabular data in rows and columns. This repository covers the basics of 2D arrays and demonstrates various operations you can perform on them.

## Declaring and Initializing 2D Arrays

Learn how to declare and initialize 2D arrays in C++. Understand the different ways to set the size and initialize the elements of a 2D array.

## Accessing Elements

Explore methods for accessing individual elements within a 2D array. Understand how the row and column indices work for different elements.

## Traversing 2D Arrays

Discover techniques for traversing 2D arrays, which are crucial for performing operations on the entire array. Learn about row-major and column-major order.

## Examples

The 'examples' directory in this repository contains C++ code samples that demonstrate different aspects of 2D arrays. These examples cover common use cases, such as matrix operations and image processing.
